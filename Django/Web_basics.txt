HTTP Requests look like:
    Get / HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.google.com

which translates to get root page of google.com by using HTTP1.1

Responses look like:

HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Content-Type : text/html

Status codes : Meaning
200 : Ok
301 : Moved Permanently
403 : Forbidden
404 : Not Found
500 : Internal Server Error

We need to set form action to GET or POST to get or send data to server 
respectively

CSRF: Cross site request forgery
This means another website can try to mimic the post/get request made
by our website and interact with server which isn't secure
To prevent CSRF we generate a token with each user sessions and when they submit 
a form they also return the token.It's like pairing
form's data with a secure key to validate the request is by our website and by
a validated user.

python manage.py migrate helps us to create default tables required for storing information by
Django.
